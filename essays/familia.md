My family is not perfect, they all have their virtues and shortcomings, but they're warriors.

I've never had to deal with extortions, with gangsters threatening my children. 
I've never had criminals in front of my house waiting for my son to intimidate him.
I never suffered abandonment from Mom and Dad; I was never put up for adoption as a child.
I've never had to lend money so that i can help my brother escape from criminals.
I've never seen my kids and decide that no matter what it takes, i'll send them to university and make them professionals.

How can i complain about my future? 
How can i waste my time in mindless entertainment?
How can i be comfortable knowing i'm capable of so much more?
