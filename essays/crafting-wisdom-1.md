For the last months i've been using [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/androso.sv/) as a vault
where i can save some of my favorite moments of that period, but i've found that it increases my
ego and puts me in a position where i'm thinking "what would make this thing prettier?" which is
pretty stupid when you have 137 followers.

The second problem is Reels. They're super addictive. Insanely addictive. A couple of months ago
i deleted facebook and Tiktok for this same reason and it's impressive how fast we forget the reasons
why we quit some unhealthy habit and proceed to do the same thing again but under a different name. (Reminds me that i need to re-read [this](https://www.amazon.com/Dopamine-Nation-Finding-Balance-Indulgence/dp/152474672X) book on addictions)

> Like a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly. Proverbs 26:11

I also wanted to do something longer. Youtube vlogs are pretty cool, and combined with some exploratory essays, they're gold
(For example videos like [this](https://youtu.be/tGolcgqrRLo?si=ZggxTeEuac0Tz-rp)), but i don't have the time
to do them and doing Instagram Reels or Tiktoks require to be using those apps for much longer than i
would want to.

So in order to avoid oversharing to the 137 people that follow me, why not overshare to the whole internet?

That's why i'm naming this section of my website Crafting Wisdomâ€”a place to share what I usually feed to my 1.3-1.4 kg mass of gray matter, called brain. This includes articles, essays, new music discoveries, books, podcasts, movies, etc.

This is basically the journal of an 8 year old girl but written in html, css, javascript
and using markdown to write the entries.
