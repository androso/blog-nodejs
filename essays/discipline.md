> Love the discipline you know, and let it guide you. Entrust everything willingly to the gods, and then make your way through life-no one's master and no one's slave - Marcus Aurelius

> A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls - Proverbs 25:28

> The one thing that changes your f*** DNA, is discipline.

(The idea of micro sucks by Andrew Huberman)

(If one wants to become great at something, one has to be disciplined, to have habits, routines, same hour, same place, same attitude)

(University, Work, relationships, they all require discipline at some point)

(I'm re-gaining my focus when working / studying after kinda losing it and Huberman saying how
you gain focus by "re-focusing" your mind each time it is distracted)
