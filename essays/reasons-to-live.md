Smiles, they're everywhere!

Each head is a world in its owns, dreams, heartbreaks, pains, joys, love, hate, stress, rest, calmness, in every single person you come across

Bugs, biology, science, poetry, math, philosophy, faith, movies, books, essays

Album covers, music, art, psychology, engineering

Theather, bakeries, the sun that feels like you're burning, moonlight

Strangers, friends, family

People i've hurt, people that have hurt me, people i've loved, people that have loved me

Mistakes i've made, mistakes i avoided, things that i don't know where they fit in

Books, books books. That scence from Amelie where she takes the blind man and describes the world to him while she kinda runs.

Birds, cats, dogs, elephants, rhinos, zebras

Jungle, desert, city, countryside.

Rivers, mountains, trips with friends, drawing with friends, coding with friends, with friends

Meditating alone, praying alone, learning alone, having fun while being alone

At points we'll take them for granted, at points they'll be the most precious treasure, we forget and we then remember.

Life.
